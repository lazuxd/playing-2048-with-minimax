# Playing 2048 with Minimax algorithm and Selenium
![alt text](imgs/playing_2048.gif)

This project implements an AI that plays the 2048 game by using the minimax algorithm and selenium webdriver for interacting with a web version of the game.   
The end result is a program that is able to automatically play the game live on our screens as you can see in the gif above.   
To understand better the project, I made a few articles that explains it, which can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/playing-2048-with-minimax).  

The code is available both as a Jupyter notebook, or as plain Python files. The main file is game_loop.py; when you run it in terminal, it opens Chrome and starts playing.  

*Happy hacking and experimenting with the code!*
